# todo-list
A school project

## Main branch
The main branch must be running fine all the time. Do not commit to the main branch unless it's a trivial change (e.g. README changes) or absolutely necessary. Always create a new pull request if you are working on an issue and only merge it after it has been approved.

#### Commits from Visual Studio
Do not commit project files created by Visual Studio. Only commit source files. 

## Project management
New issues are automatically added to the project board. If you start working on an issue, assign it to yourself and move it to "in progress". Link pull requests to issues in order to move them to "done" automatically when the pull request was merged.
If a task depends on another, move it to "on hold".
